# From keys to ink: a code and machine workflow

This short talk is an illustrated walkthrough into a minimalistic creative algorithm. Without focusing on the technological aspect of coding, I'll explain how a few ingredients can lead to a simple generative system; and how data visualization can help to explore and interact with your creation. I'll also describe how a pen-plotting machine can help you to go further than digital outputs. The slides in this repository are released under a CC-BY-4.0 license.
